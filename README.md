task 1: This code defines the processArray function, which accepts an array of numbers as an input. Every even integer is squared and every odd number is tripled in a new array that is created using the map technique. After that, the function is exported so that other modules can use it.

task 2: The two arrays that this code defines as arguments for the new function formatArrayStrings are an array of numbers (numArr) and an array of strings (strArr). Each text is altered using the map method according to the associated number; if the number is even, the entire string is capitalised; if the number is odd, the entire string is converted to lowercase. After that, the two functions are exported as an object so that other modules can use them.

task 3: This code specifies a function named createUserProfiles that accepts an array of names (names) and an array of changed names (modifiedNames), and imports the arrayManipulation module. It generates a new array of objects using the map method, each with the originalName, modifiedName, and an auto-incremented id beginning at 1. After that, the function is exported for usage in other modules.
